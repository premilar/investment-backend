Here's a README for FastAPI:

# FastAPI

## Overview

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Key Features

- **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
- **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.
- **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.
- **Intuitive**: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
- **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
- **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration.
- **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
- **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.

## Installation

```bash
pip install fastapi
```

You'll also need an ASGI server, for production such as Uvicorn or Hypercorn:

```bash
pip install uvicorn
```

## Quick Start

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

Run the server with:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation (provided by Swagger UI) and alternative API documentation (provided by ReDoc).

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for the Swagger UI docs.
Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc` for the ReDoc docs.

## Dependencies

FastAPI is built on top of:

- Starlette for the web parts
- Pydantic for the data parts
